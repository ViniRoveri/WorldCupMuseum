With a responsability of the size of the world on his foot, Muani strikes the most important kick of his career, but is stopped by the calf of Dibu, that not only saved the ball, but also Argentina's whole World Cup dreams by himself. This save led the game to the penalty shootouts, where Dibu could keep his star shining and made France lose 2 penalties, becoming the greatest hero of the night Argentina got its third World Cup title.`
